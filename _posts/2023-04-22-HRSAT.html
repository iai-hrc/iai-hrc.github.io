    <p>
        Future manufacturing will witness a shift in human-robot relationships towards collaboration, 
        compassion and coevolution. This will require seamless human-robot knowledge transfer. 
        Differences in language and knowledge representation hinder the transfer of knowledge 
        among humans and robots. Thus, a unified knowledge representation system that can be shared 
        by humans and robots is essential. Driven by this need in a product assembly scenario, we 
        propose the Human-Robot Shared Assembly Taxonomy (HR-SAT). With HR-SAT, any comprehensive 
        assembly task can be represented as a knowledge graph that both humans and robots can understand. 
        <br /><br />
        HR-SAT enables utilisation in various applications as a hierarchical, consistent and 
        information-rich representation

    <h2 class="section-heading">HR-SAT</h2>
    <p>
        HR-SAT has a hierarchical structure which decomposes a task into primitive tasks 
        and primitive tasks into atomic actions. Definitions of <em>task</em>, <em>primitive task</em> 
        and <em>atomic action</em> are based on the <em>functional state change</em> of the manipulated object and 
        the <em>interaction state change</em> between the subject and manipulated object.
        <br /><br />
        For better utilisation of HR-SAT, we also define nine atomic actions common in assembly processes.

    <p>
        To flexibly describe the assembly task, we proposed the task description framework and modeled
        it as a knowledge graph.

        This study presents an assistive assembly and quality assurance framework for a hydraulic valve assembly.
        In this framework, HR-SAT can convert the disparate process information in the assembly instructions into 
        a unified process representation in the form of a knowledge graph. From the knowledge graph, the primitive 
        task and key atomic action nodes are extracted to obtain a unified instruction.
        <br /><br />
        The generated unified instruction can then be used in to obtain personalised instructions, which is used to 
        assist the worker as well as to cross-check with the assembly process monitoring for quality assurance.

    <h3>Case Study 2: Human-Robot Collaborative Assembly</h3>

    <p>
        This case study presents the human-robot collaborative assembly framework for the Generic Assembly Box (GAB).
        In this framework, HR-SAT converts the disparate assembly process information (such as video demonstrations) into 
        a unified Subject-agnostic Task Graph, which provides a universal process description for any agent. From the 
        Subject-agnostic Task Graph, the primitive tasks and even atomic actions are allocated to agents to obtain the 
        HRC Task Graph. The allocation is based on the agent's capability and availability, guided by optimization 
        objectives such as overall efficiency and human wellbeing.
        <br /><br />
        From the obtained HRC Task Graph, personalized instructions can be generated for human workers and executable 
        policies can be generated through motion planning for robots. During the collaborative task, the robot's policy 
        is updated dynamically by monitoring and predicting the human to ensure worker safety and collaborative efficiency.
