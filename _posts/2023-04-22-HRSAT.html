<h2 class="section-heading">Human-Robot Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>
    Future manufacturing will witness a shift in human-robot relationships towards collaboration, 
    compassion and coevolution. This will require seamless human-robot knowledge transfer. 
    Differences in language and knowledge representation hinder the transfer of knowledge 
    among humans and robots. Thus, a unified knowledge representation system that can be shared 
    by humans and robots is essential. Driven by this need in a product assembly scenario, we 
    propose the Human-Robot Shared Assembly Taxonomy (HR-SAT). With HR-SAT, any comprehensive 
    assembly task can be represented as a knowledge graph that both humans and robots can understand. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The HR-SAT</h2>
<p>
    The proposed HR-SAT can express diverse assembly processes as a formal, structured and unified 
    representation that can be shared by humans and robots. This representation hierarchy is 
    applicable to various applications.
